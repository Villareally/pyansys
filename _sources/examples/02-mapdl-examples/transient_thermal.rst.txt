Example Thermal Transient Analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This example shows how you can use `pyansys` to input a time dependent
temperature table to vary the temperature at a beam.  This uses
convection loads with independently varying convection coefficient and
bulk temperature.

Setup the Solution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solve a transient analysis while ramping the load up and down.

Note the solution time commands in the above code fragment. The
final TIME is set to 1000 seconds. Time substep size is permitted to
range from a minimum of 2 seconds to a maximum of 50 seconds in the
DELTIM command. A first substep of 10 seconds is applied. Automatic
time substep sizing will vary substeps between the extremes.

A Table Array is used for the time-dependent Convection Coefficient
values. Times go in the Zeroth column, while associated Convection
Coefficients go in the First column.

                        [700, 300],    # hold temperature for 200 seconds
                        [900, 75],     # temperature ramps down for 200 seconds
                        [end_time, 75]])   # end of second "flat" zone
    mapdl.load_table('my_bulk', my_bulk, 'TIME')









The Transient Thermal Solve
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This model is to be solved in one time step. For this reason, a
``TSRES`` command is used for force the solver to include a
``SOLVE`` at every time point in the two Table Arrays above. This
ensures that the time-dependent curves are followed by the transient
analysis. Intermediate solutions between the ``TSRES`` time points
will be included according to the ``DELTIM`` command and the
automatic time stepping decisions of the ANSYS solver.

In this example, the times for the ``TSRES`` array illustrated above
have been determined manually. A set of APDL commands could be used
to automate this process for chosen Table Array entries, in more
complex modeling situations, including checks that no time intervals
are too short.

Results at substeps will be wanted if the intermediate solutions of
the time-transient analysis are to be available for post-processing
review. The ``OUTRES`` command is used to control how much is written to
the results file. In this example the OUTRES command will be used to
simply write out all results for all substeps. In work with large
models and may substeps, too much data will be written if such a
strategy is employed for ``OUTRES``, and other options will need to be
considered. Note that one option for the ``OUTRES`` command is to
control times at which results are written with a Table Array, much
as is used in the ``TSRES`` command, but typically for a larger number
of time points, although including those of the TSRES array.

The initial condition starting temperature is controlled for this
example with the ``TUNIF`` command. Note that thermal transient
analyses can also have a starting temperature profile formed by a
static thermal ``SOLVE``. If a user neglects to set an initial
temperature in ANSYS Mechanical APDL, a value of zero will be used,
which is often not what is desired.

The thermal convective loads are applied with an SF family
command—in this example a convective load is applied to the end face
of the solid model by the SFA command, using the Table Array entries
for convection and bulk temperature that were developed above. The
Table Array names are surrounded with percent signs (%).  A SOLVE is
then performed.
